## Description
A book called "Head First C" has this as it's last exercise.

This project was started in Ubuntu Linux, but then transfered to MacOS with an M1 chip.
So some things have changed.

It's written in C with the help of allegro5.

Alternatively you can use brew:

    brew install allegro5

or apt:

    sudo apt-get install liballegro5-dev

Then run 
    
    make

Binary will be `bin/ship`
